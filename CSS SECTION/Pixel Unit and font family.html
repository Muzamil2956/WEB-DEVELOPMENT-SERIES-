    <h1>Operating System</h1>
    <p>This comprehensive text covers the principles of modern operating systems in detail and
        illustrates them with numerous real-world examples. After an introductory chapter, the next
        five chapters deal with the basic concepts: processes and threads, deadlocks, memory
        management, input/output, and file systems. The next six chapters deal with more advanced
        material, including multimedia systems, multiple processor systems, security. Finally, two
        detailed case studies are given: UNIX/Linux and Windows 2000</p>
