<!--- Specificity is an algorithm that calculates the weight that is appllied to a given CSS decleration 
 ----------- for id
----------- for class,attribute and pseudo-class
------------ for element and pseudo-element 
E.g  h2{
    background-color:yellow;       specificity here is 0  0  1 for id,class,element
}
imp points

id>class>element    priority
more selectors > less selectors
if specificity same then cascading will be done ie last property applied
inline style has higher priority than id >
